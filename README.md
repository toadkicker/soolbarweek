# What is this?

This was a website (now defunct) to support Sool Bar Week, an event coordinated through this application.

## Features
It has custom content manager with language translations coming out of the database.

It has a gallery component that supports uploads and displays them back on the page

It has venue and event management

It has a bio page with an image and whatever description the administrator enters for that language

There is probably more it does, but that's just what I can remember.

## Why did you open source this?

The site is defunct and won't ever come back to life. However there is a lot of useful stuff in here like:

How to configure rails i18n to the database

How to do uploads

How to build event management controllers

How to do payments with Stripe in multiple languages/currencies

More...

Cheers!
