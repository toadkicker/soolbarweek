  "dustin_wessa_desc": "Dustin Wessa, ‘chef’ owner of Dandy Pink is a slightly odd eccentric obsessed first and foremost with the flavors of the forest.  Known for filling baskets with wild mushrooms and native herbs and preferring coal and wood as fuel to the comforts of a modern kitchen, his style of cookery could be considered archaic.  A self defined alcoholist(sic) the bounty of the wild often finds its way into tenacious tinctures and bizarre bitters.  He’d rather be scrapin up bits of nature, creepin towards Valhalla and collaborating with those that cook better than breathing sanitizer in a stainless steel fortress.",

Until Cocktail Kingdom, there was no easy way to differentiate a professional bartender from someone with a casual interest,” he explains.  “We enabled the cocktail renaissance by giving significant cocktail programs the tools to distinguish themselves.”</p><p>Boehm is also the owner of the award-winning cocktail bars Mace and Boilermaker, both located in New York’s East Village.</p><p>Boehm, who comes from a family of independent publishers and bibliophiles, first became interested in the craft cocktail world nearly two decades ago when the family business began publishing the books of the legendary London bartender Salvatore Calabrese.</p><p>Boehm grew his personal library into the largest collection of cocktail books in the world, including more than 2,800 rare and one-of-a-kind pieces, such as his newly acquired 1948 pre-frost edition proof of the “the best book on cocktail theory every written,” *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks*, by David Embury.  He keeps the collection in a working research library in New York, which draws bartenders and writers from around the world.</p>",
